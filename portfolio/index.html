                <h2>Hello, I'm Lana 👋</h2>
                <p>Based off OC, I'm currently a second year majoring in computer science! Growing up I've always been glued to video games and would wonder, 
                    "How are these games made? How is this website made?" this inspired me to become interested in coding and explore tech careers. I'm not naturally gifted/talented, but based off my past experiences during my education 
                    I'm confident enough to say that my greatest weapon is being able to sit down and grind for hours.

                    When I was younger I wanted to be everything; teacher, doctor, firefighter, optometrist, etc. Though one problem I had was that I never focused on doing good in school,
                    all I did was play video games and didn't care about learning anything, hence why I was considered "slow" by my teachers. Even though my addiction to video games set
                    me back on my education it doesn't matter because in the end, I was able to catch up through years of relearning, failure, and discipline. 
                    And if it weren't for my love of video games, I would've never tried developing my own game on Roblox, which sparked my interest in coding.

                    I don't want you to think that coding is the only thing I have going on in my life, every other hobby that I have clearly demonstrates and contributes to who I am today and how I was able to even 
                    become the person I am today. I've been going to the gym since 2023 and the only times where I've been inconsistent with it was during my first year of college second semester, because I struggled balancing
                    classes, my first job, real friendships, and my first relationship. I love the gym and eating healthy, so you would typically call this a lifestyle but I like to call it a hobby! I also love listening to
                    classical music and playing the violin, I wish that more people appreciated instruments and could experience the feeling of listening to how beautiful instruments can sound. Reading books was not an
                    interest of mine until late teens when I randomly became interested in space. All of these contribute to who I am today because I wouldn't been able to consistently go to the gym if I didn't force
                    myself to despite being exhaused because of my discipline. Relearning the violin taught me perserverance, even though I am not as good as I used to be, I am determined to master
                    the instrument because it's too beautiful to give up on, and it would fulfill my younger self's dream of returning to the violin someday. Lastly, if a book wasn't fun or interesting to me,
                    then I hated it. I sucked at reading and I hated it, but I wanted to improve and my curiosity of the ocean, our history, geography, and space helped push me into reading books and articles. Instead of running away
                    from the books, I kept on reading and reading until reading became less of a hassle, but more of a relaxing break that allows me to learn things I never knew before and that's the beauty of it.
                    I was able to develop a growth mindset through reading, and this greatly helped me in my courses especially calculus. I have a lot of other interests that I want to do such as scubadiving, 
                    whale watching, swimming with marine animals, learning other instruments, and soon I'll even be able to go snowboarding which is something I've been wanting to do for a long time.
                    
                    There is so much to experience in life, and I am grateful to be alive today. 
                    I am proud of the person I have become and hope that my presence can inspire others to be more optimistic and, one day, allow me to mentor others.
